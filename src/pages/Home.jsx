             I was bored, so I made this portfolio. The picture above is from my graduation day at 
             Arizona State University, where I graduated summa cum laude in Computer Science. 
             It feels a bit strange to talk about myself like this haha, but I‚Äôm a curious and creative tech lover who 
             enjoys learning new things and building projects that actually work. I love exploring new 
             technology and finding smart ways to solve problems but for me, tech is more than just work, 
             it‚Äôs a passion.

              I'm really passionate about working on AI and Machine Learning{" "}
              projects, especially as part of a team where we can bounce around ideas and build
              something impactful together. Lately, I‚Äôve been diving into the{" "}
              fintech and stock market world, exploring how tech can transform
              finance and I‚Äôve even worked on projects in that space. I love taking what I
              learn and applying it to real-world problems. Outside of tech, I enjoy{" "}
              meeting new people, networking, and having meaningful conversations.
              I‚Äôve also been playing tennis since I was five, which has taught me
              discipline, focus, and fun. I'm constantly inspired by{" "}
              strong women in tech and hope to do the same that is keep learning and
              uplift others along the way. Feel free to check out some of my projects in the Projects section ‚Äî they‚Äôre pretty cool, I promise!!!!
